Creating the mandala output using the p5.js Web Editor

Honestly, I don't know much about coding and p5.js so I decided to have the simplest design that my limited knowledge of coding and p5.js programming language could make. I didn't have any inspiration whatsoever, I just did what looked nice, clean and simple that remotely resembles the patterns seen on mandalas.

I want to learn how to use formulas to shorten my codes because as you can see, my codes are very amateur-ish and so that I could begin to create designs that are a lot more intricate.
